# Overview

Uses the SparkFun OTOS Quickstart for Roadrunner 1.0 :)

The custom localization is implemented using the SparkFunOTOSDrive class, which *extends* MecanumDrive.
This means that all of RoadRunner's standard tuning should remain in MecanumDrive, but you should use SparkFunOTOSDrive
in your OpModes.
